# Python for astronomy
This repository is for uploading some of the projects I have worked on and to also upload notebooks of other smaller projects made during python courses. The files: TESS lightcurves, Feature extraction and 41259805 sector01 are all using data from de TESS satellite. The rest of the files are a few small python activities made at a python for astronomers course using sciserver platfrom.
